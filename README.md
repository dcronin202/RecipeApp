# Recipe App

This app displays a list of baking recipes and allows users to follow guided step-by-step video instructions. When a user taps on a recipe card, they are transitioned to a screen that shows the ingredients and list of steps. From there, they can also click on a button that takes them to scrollable step-by-step tabs for each individual recipe step and accompanying videos (if available).

The app also features a widget that displays smaller versions of the recipe cards. When the user clicks on a card, they are taken to the screen that has the recipe's ingredients and list of instructions.
